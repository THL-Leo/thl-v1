description: Maybe some people shouldn't just give up

NeetCode's latest video, `Maybe some people should just give up`, is really different from the usual content he does. When I watched it, I felt so compelled to write something because it is just so accurate. 

During my time in Bachelor's or Master's, I watched his videos on LeetCode because he gives really detailed solutions and thought processes. I often found myself just watching the video and trying to memorize the solution instead of actually understanding it. 

This really hurt me when I took algorithms in my Master's because I didn't understand the intricate nature of the problems. Topics like *Divide and Conquer* and *Linear Programming* require mathematical knowledge to break down why and how they work. For someone who is really only interested in building software, it wasn't a good match.

I think while he may be a little too pessimistic about future SWEs, I do agree that a lot of us are just expecting to be spoon-fed the solution. It is definitely a video worth watching and definitely something to think about. We are not that dumb and we should be able to think for ourselves before diving straight for the answer. 

Anyways, I think I will write another blog once I get the inspiration for it. Life has been great so far and I really appreciate my team and the people who I work with. Happy Thanksgiving!
