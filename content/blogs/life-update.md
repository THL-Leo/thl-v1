I would love to get a Rhino beetle as a pet. I remember having these when I was young. I also remember playing some Japanese card games called Mushiking. They also have Dinosaur and other Animals iirc. It was really cool. 

I remember I collected like hundreds of these cards and hoped to get the White Hercules Beetle since it has the highest attack. In the end I never got it but I still remember collecting and comparing all of the beetles there are.

I also remember watching some Mushiking movie in the theatre with my family. It was honestly so bad but I really loved it. The giant beetles flying across the screen and smashing into each other. What a great time back then.
