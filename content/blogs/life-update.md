I would love to get a Rhino beetle as a pet. I had these when I was young, and I used to play a Japanese card game called Mushiking. Iirc, they also had versions with dinosaurs and other animals. It was really cool. 

I collected around hundreds of these cards, hoping to get the White Hercules Beetle since it had the highest attack. In the end, I never got it, but this made me really interested in beetles and ended up getting around 10 of them as pets growing up.

I also watched a Mushiking movie in the theater with my family. It was honestly pretty bad, but I loved it. Giant beetles flying across the screen and smashing into each other. Enemies will have dark shadows around them with red eyes. The main character always struggles to defeat the enemy and save the world.

What a great time to be alive.
