To be honest, I don't really know why I am writing these blogs. I just wanted some way of documenting my thought processing when learning new materials. I tried using Threads or Twitter, but, quite frankly, something about social media scares me.

Anyways, here you will find my ramblings about technology, programming languages, machine learning, and probably other niche interests that I have. 

## Who am I

If you are here, welcome to my Blog. My name is Leo and I am a USC new grad from the MSCS program.
I previously interned at AMD and [Fortis Lab](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~yzhao010/lab.html). You 
can find my name all the way on the bottom of the page :)

I like building tools to improve my efficiency. I have been looking into things like n8n or firecrawl,
to help me with my daily tasks. I also like to mess around with **machine learning**, albeit I am very much doing **human learning**, I want to learn more about the math behind why we do things the way it is.

I will write and keep my notes in these blogs from time to time so feel free to reach out if you find anything interesting. You can find me at the Contact section at the RHS of the navbar. Also, my github link should be there as well. Feel free to check it out.
